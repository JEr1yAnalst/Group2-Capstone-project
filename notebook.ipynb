    "## 1.0  PROJECT OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze and predict customer sentiment towards various airlines by leveraging a dataset of customer feedback. The project will apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral and use time series analysis to forecast future sentiment trends. These insights will help airlines enhance customer satisfaction, tailor their services, and address issues proactively."

    "## 1.1  BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "\n",
    "In the competitive landscape of the airline industry, understanding and managing customer sentiment is crucial for maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Airlines receive a substantial amount of feedback through various channels such as social media, customer service interactions, and surveys. Analyzing this feedback to discern customer sentiment and predict future trends can provide significant benefits. By proactively addressing customer concerns, airlines can enhance their service quality, optimize operational efficiency, and build a strong reputation. This project seeks to provide airlines with the tools and insights necessary to identify common themes in customer feedback, understand how sentiment evolves over time, and forecast future sentiment trends. These insights will enable airlines to make data-driven decisions that improve customer experiences, resolve issues proactively, and maintain a competitive advantage in the market."

    "## 1.2  PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "The airline industry is currently facing a notable decrease in customer satisfaction, leading to unfavorable brand perception and diminished customer loyalty. This decline in satisfaction can be attributed to several factors, including flight delays, inadequate customer service, mishandling of luggage, and other operational inefficiencies. As a result, addressing these customer concerns and enhancing the overall brand perception has become a crucial focus for airlines."
