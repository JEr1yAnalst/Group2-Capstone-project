    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze and predict customer sentiment towards various airlines by leveraging a dataset of customer feedback. The project will apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral and use time series analysis to forecast future sentiment trends. These insights will help airlines enhance customer satisfaction, tailor their services, and address issues proactively."

    "\n",
    "The airline industry is currently facing a notable decrease in customer satisfaction, leading to unfavorable brand perception and diminished customer loyalty. This decline in satisfaction can be attributed to several factors, including flight delays, inadequate customer service, mishandling of luggage, and other operational inefficiencies. As a result, addressing these customer concerns and enhancing the overall brand perception has become a crucial focus for airlines."
